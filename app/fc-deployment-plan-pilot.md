**FC Deployment Plan**
**A measured pilot for subscriber growth**

**Date:** {{Date}}

> A structured experiment to test whether physical NFC touchpoints can drive measurable subscription outcomes.

---

## Page 2｜Executive Summary

### What this is

This document outlines a **pilot deployment plan** to test the impact of **physical NFC magnets** on subscription-driven businesses.

The goal is to evaluate whether a persistent, offline touchpoint can improve:

* Subscriber acquisition behavior
* Engagement between content sessions
* Early signals of renewal intent

This is **not a guaranteed ROI program**, but a controlled experiment with defined cost, scope, and review points.

---

### Key numbers (12-month base case)

* **Estimated net impact:** **–$17,070 / year**
* **Upfront investment:** **$20,000**
* **Estimated payback period:** **~81.9 months**

📌 These figures reflect a **base-case projection over the first 12 months**, assuming current pricing and billing cadence remain unchanged.

---

## Page 3｜Why this pilot exists

### The subscription problem FC is addressing

Content subscriptions rarely fail due to content quality.
They fail because **value fades between sessions**.

Common patterns we observe:

* Users intend to return, but forget
* Paid subscribers feel less perceived value before renewal
* Most touchpoints are ephemeral (inbox, feeds, notifications)

FC’s core hypothesis is simple:

> **Persistent physical touchpoints can extend content recall and subscription intent over time.**

This pilot exists to test that hypothesis under real operating conditions.

## Page 4｜What is being deployed

### Deployment scope

* **Total magnets:** **2,000**
* **Unit cost:** **$10 / magnet**
* **Total upfront cost:** **$20,000**

This quantity is selected to balance **signal strength** and **cost efficiency** for an initial deployment.

---

### Allocation logic

| Segment    | Quantity | Purpose                                             |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Free users | 1,500    | Test incremental conversion into paid subscriptions |
| Paid users | 500      | Observe early renewal and engagement signals        |

This allocation prioritizes **growth signal clarity** while limiting exposure during the pilot phase.

## Page 5｜Plan choice

### Plan A — Growth Only

This pilot focuses primarily on **incremental subscriber growth** before attempting deeper retention optimization.

Why start with growth:

* Growth signals emerge faster and are easier to isolate
* Retention effects are typically delayed and require longer observation windows
* A growth-first pilot reduces interpretation ambiguity

Retention optimization can be layered in **after initial validation**.

---

## Page 6｜How the projection is calculated (high-level)

The projected impact is derived from **three factors only**:

1. **Incremental paid subscribers**
   Driven by NFC-enabled engagement and conversion behavior

2. **Early signals of extended subscriber lifetime**
   Observed through repeat interaction and renewal-adjacent actions

3. **Minus total program cost**
   Including magnet production and deployment

All other variables remain constant:

* Pricing
* Billing cadence
* Existing content strategy

📌 This keeps the pilot **focused, measurable, and falsifiable**.

## Page 7｜Timeline: What happens after kickoff

### Deployment timeline

1. **Kickoff — Dec 30, 2025**
   Confirm quantity, timeline, pricing, points of contact, and communication cadence.

2. **Asset handoff — Jan 1, 2026**
   Brand assets and content source (link / RSS / page).

3. **Link & flow validation — Jan 4, 2026**
   NFC destination and subscription/payment flow validation.

4. **Design approval — Jan 8, 2026**
   Final visuals and copy are frozen.

5. **Sampling (deposit) — Jan 11, 2026**
   Sample production and shipment.

6. **Sample acceptance — Jan 14, 2026**
   Approval or minor edits within acceptance criteria.

7. **Mass production & shipping — Feb 3, 2026**

8. **Delivery & final payment — Feb 18, 2026**

## Page 8｜Measurement & review

### How success is evaluated

This pilot is designed to generate **directional clarity**, not vanity metrics.

Signals reviewed include:

* NFC activation behavior
* Return visits and follow-up actions
* Subscription-adjacent events

Initial signals are reviewed after rollout to determine:

* Whether effects are observable
* Whether adjustments are warranted
* Whether a scaled deployment is justified

---

## Page 9｜Incentive alignment & risk posture

### Incentive alignment

FC benefits **only when subscriber behavior improves**.
This pilot is structured so that incentives are aligned, not front-loaded.

Commercial terms beyond the pilot are discussed **after validation**, not before.

---

### Risk posture

* Outcomes may underperform projections
* Effects may take longer than 12 months to materialize
* This pilot is intentionally scoped to limit downside while preserving learning value

📌 The primary goal of this deployment is **evidence**, not certainty.

---

## Page 10｜Decision & next step

### If this approach aligns

The next step is intentionally simple:

* Confirm pilot quantity
* Confirm kickoff date

No long-term commitment is required at this stage.

We’re happy to walk through assumptions, methodology, or open questions before you decide.
